# Observations

1. The compliance is highest for age groups 50-64 and 0-17, while it is significantly lower in the 18-34 age range.

2. Native Americans exhibit the highest compliance, while the "Other" racial group may require targeted interventions to improve flu shot rates.

3. The increase in flu shots in April is interesting, as flu season typically starts in the fall. This might indicate a late surge, possibly due to public health campaigns or delays in vaccine distribution.

4. There is a noticeable drop in compliance among young people (18-34), which aligns with the overall age group trend. Public health campaigns could focus on younger demographics.
